## 2026-06-01: keep `workspace:^` for internal deps, guard the packed tarball in CI

Context: `pack-nextjs` peer-depends on `pack-monorepo`. The risk flagged by audit:
`npm pack`/`npm publish` do not understand the workspace protocol, so `workspace:^`
would leak verbatim into a tarball published with npm.

Attempt rejected: switch to an explicit `^<version>` range so the source is
npm-safe. Verified empirically that this BREAKS: `pack-monorepo` is not published
to npm, and pnpm 9 defaults to `link-workspace-packages=false`, so a plain range
resolves against the registry and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` fails with
`ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` / unresolved package. The workspace: protocol is
therefore REQUIRED for unpublished internal deps; the earlier "use a literal
range" idea (and a bump-version range-rewriter) was reverted.

Decision: keep `workspace:^` in source. pnpm pack/publish rewrites it to
`^<version>` (verified: the packed tarball carries `^0.5.4`). A CI + release gate
(`scripts/check-publish-safety.mjs`) packs each npm package with pnpm and fails
if a `workspace:` specifier survives into the tarball. This verifies the artifact
we actually ship and catches a conversion regression (bad `.npmrc`, pnpm change).
It does NOT, and cannot, stop a manual `npm publish` that bypasses our tooling:
RELEASING.md mandates `pnpm -r publish`, and that process rule is the boundary of
what an in-repo check can enforce.
