## 2026-06-01: Biome as the linter (over ESLint)

Context: the root `lint` script fanned out to per-package `lint` scripts that
did not exist, so `pnpm lint` printed "None of the selected packages has a lint
script" and exited 0. A quality harness shipped with a gate that gated nothing.

Decision: adopt Biome (`@biomejs/biome`) as the single linter. Root `lint`
script is `biome lint`; config lives in `biome.json`, scoped to first-party
TypeScript (`packages/**/src`, config files, `test/`) and excluding `dist`,
`node_modules`, `templates`, and `*.d.ts`. A CI step runs `pnpm lint`.

Alternatives considered:
- ESLint + typescript-eslint: more rules and plugins, but heavier install,
  slower, and needs a flat-config plus parser wiring. Overkill for a small CLI.
- Keep the fan-out and add per-package ESLint: more moving parts, same result.

Why Biome won: single binary, near-zero config, fast, and the hooks already
treat both `biome` and `eslint.config` as known toolchain markers. The formatter
is left disabled in the gate (`biome lint`, not `biome check`) so the gate
enforces correctness without forcing a repo-wide reformat.
