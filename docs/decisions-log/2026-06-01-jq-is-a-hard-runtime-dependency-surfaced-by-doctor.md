## 2026-06-01: jq is a hard runtime dependency, surfaced by doctor

Context: 15 of the 20 hooks parse the Claude Code tool-call JSON from stdin with
jq. On a machine without jq the hooks fail open and silently stop enforcing.

Decision: `void-harness doctor` now checks for jq alongside gh, with an install
hint. jq stays an external dependency (not bundled): it is ubiquitous and
bundling a binary per platform is not worth the weight.
