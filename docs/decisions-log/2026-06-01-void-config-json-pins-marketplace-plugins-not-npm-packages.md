## 2026-06-01: .void/config.json pins marketplace plugins, not npm packages

Context: the `packs` field in `.void/config.json` is written by `init` as
`@voidcorp/<plugin-name>` (e.g. `@voidcorp/harness-nextjs`) and read back by
`doctor` in the same shape. The docs example instead showed `@voidcorp/pack-nextjs`
(the npm package name), mixing two vocabularies for the same field.

Decision: the field pins marketplace plugins (what `doctor` compares against the
marketplace HEAD), keyed `@voidcorp/<plugin-name>`. Docs were aligned to the
runtime; the schema was left unchanged to avoid breaking existing consumer
configs. The npm package names (`@voidcorp/pack-<stack>`) are a separate concern
(runtime `import`s), documented as such.

Alternative rejected: rekey the field to npm package names. That would require
changing init + doctor in lockstep and would break any `.void/config.json`
already written in consumer projects, for no functional gain (doctor needs the
plugin identity, not the npm name).
