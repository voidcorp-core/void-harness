# Releasing void-harness

How to ship a new version. One model, one number — everything moves together.

## Model: total lockstep (pre-1.0)

While the harness is pre-1.0, **one version governs everything** that carries a version (below).
Distinguish **versioned** (all manifests, in lockstep) from **published to npm** (only the CLI):

- Plugin manifests (each `plugin.json`; the catalog is self-hosted at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) — versioned.
- Packs (`@voidcorp/pack-monorepo`, `@voidcorp/pack-nextjs`, …) and the `@voidcorp/harness-graph`
  kernel — versioned, but **not published to npm**: packs ship via the marketplace, and the kernel is
  bundled into the CLI (see DECISIONS.md 2026-07-22).
- **CLI npm package (`voidmachine`, named in `packages/core/data/identity.json`) — the only package
  published to npm.** Self-contained (the kernel is bundled in), so `npx voidmachine` needs nothing
  else from the registry. Releases up to 3.x were published under the former name the identity
  keeps in `formerPackages`.

A skill change, a CLI bugfix, and a runtime helper addition all ship under the same version bump.

### Why one number

- **Coherence.** A skill that references a runtime helper ships in the same version as that helper.
- **Trace.** `void-machine --version` matches `pnpm view voidmachine version` matches the marketplace HEAD.
- **No skew incidents.** Pre-1.0, every divergence is a support nightmare. Lockstep eliminates the question.

### When we might split (post-1.0)

If runtime npm packages and Claude Code plugins develop genuinely independent cadences (multiple pack runtime patches between marketplace releases), we revisit. Until that's a real observed problem, single number stays.

## Branches: what each one guarantees

Two long-lived branches, with different gates and different levels of autonomy.

| | `develop` | `main` |
|---|---|---|
| Merged by | native auto-merge, once every required check passes, `independent-review` included | a human, after reading the change as a whole; `void-enforce` refuses an armed auto-merge |
| Guarantees | the suite passed and the doctrine floor held | the above, plus a human said yes |
| CI (`ci.yml`, `void-enforce.yml`) | job set of `main`, plus `independent-review` and the `merge_group` trigger | identical job set to `develop`, no merge queue |
| `release.yml` | never fires | fires on every push — release-please, then publish |
| Server-side protection | same required checks as `main`, no force-push, no deletion | unchanged |

**`develop` is the integration branch, so it carries the *same* checks as `main`,
not fewer.** Auto-merge is the default way into it: native auto-merge waits for
branch protection and every required check, so arming it early bypasses nothing,
and `independent-review` holds each pull request until a reviewer in a fresh
context approved its exact head. `void-enforce` refuses an armed auto-merge on any
pull request into `main`, the promotion and the release pull request included:
those are the two release actions below, and a person takes both. A `develop`
without CI would make every automation path blind, which is why protection
failures are treated as unprotected rather than inferred safe.

The continuous autopilot loop still never arms a change to the machinery that
judges merges (workflows, the verdict check, the programme, the hooks): it hands
those pull requests to a person.

The promotion audit in `promotion.yml` follows the same rule: every commit it
promotes entered `develop` through a merged pull request, and
`scripts/promotion-authority.mjs` accepts that pull request in exactly three
cases. Its head SHA carries a successful `independent-review` check run from
the review App, the review the required check demanded before it could merge, whoever merged it and
whatever its timeline records: `gh pr merge --auto` on a pull request already
mergeable merges at once and leaves no auto-merge event. Or it was merged
by hand by the named human, with no auto-merge or merge queue event in its
timeline. Or it is the release
back-merge, proved by construction with the same check the `independent-review`
job runs, replayed against `develop` as it stood (the first parent of the
integration commit); one that does not hold needs the verdict like any other
automatic merge. Everything else refuses the promotion, and so does every doubt:
a missing field, a check not read on the head, a truncated timeline, a git or
API error. Automatic merges into `develop` therefore reach `main` only with the
evidence that let them merge, and the promotion itself stays a human merge.

**`develop` merges through a merge queue.** Every workflow that carries a
required check of `develop` also answers `merge_group`, the only event a queue
waits on, and falls back to the group's `base_sha` wherever it read the pull
request base. The review itself is a job, `independent-review.yml`, on
`pull_request_target`: it reads the head as data with read-only tools and
publishes the `independent-review` check on it as the review App, a GitHub App
of its own holding the Checks permission alone. Branch protection requires the
check from that App, so a check under the same name from any workflow's
`GITHUB_TOKEN` does not count. In the queue, `independent-review-queue.yml`
runs on `workflow_run` of `ci` for each merge group, requires every pull
request of the group to carry the App's successful check on its own head, and
posts the App's check on the group commit. Both run from `main`, the default
branch, so a change to the review applies once promoted, and both read the
App's key (`REVIEW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`) and the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from the
`independent-review` environment, whose deployment branch policy admits `main`
alone; the App's ids are the repository variables `REVIEW_APP_CLIENT_ID` and
`REVIEW_APP_ID`. See [the merge queue decision](decisions-log/2026-09-22-develop-merge-queue-review-verdict--413ec9cd-c186-4933-916f-215ae8dd54bb.md)
and [the review App decision](decisions-log/2026-09-24-review-check-from-its-own-app--03e82acc-0f4b-4718-9b88-3d1b2acd4903.md).

Releasing is unchanged and still happens **only from `main`**: `release.yml` is
triggered by `push: branches: [main]` and nothing about the two-branch flow touches
it. `develop` never publishes anything. Work reaches `main` through a human-merged
PR from `develop`; a hotfix applied directly to `main` must be merged back down, or
`develop` silently diverges and starts testing a tree that no longer matches what
ships.

### The promotion pull request opens itself, and stops there

`promotion.yml` runs on every push to `develop` and keeps a `develop` to `main`
pull request standing whenever `develop` holds something `main` does not. It
opens one and never merges it, which is the whole point: merging it is the gate,
and it is the only decision in the cycle that is about content rather than
mechanics. What is automated is the typing, not the judgement.

It opens with the log of what it carries, because this is the one pull request
whose diff is meant to be read as a whole.

So a release costs exactly two human actions: merge the promotion, then merge
the release pull request that release-please proposes on `main`. The first says
what ships, the second sends it to npm. The back-merge below closes the loop
without asking.

### The back-merge is automatic, because the divergence is structural

Merging the release PR writes the version bumps and the changelog to `main`, so
`main` gains commits `develop` does not have on **every** release, and protection
being `strict` refuses the next promotion until they meet. That happened three
times in one day before it was automated.

It is worth being precise about why this is repaired rather than designed away.
Pointing release-please at `develop` would remove the divergence at its source,
and it was the first thing considered. It also proposes a release the moment a
commit lands on `develop`, which is before the human decision that the `main`
gate exists to make. The divergence is therefore a consequence of `main` being
the gate, not a wiring mistake, and automating the repair is the honest trade.

`back-merge.yml` runs on every push to `main` and opens a `main` to `develop`
pull request whenever `main` holds a commit `develop` does not. It decides on
ancestry rather than on content: a promotion leaves a merge commit on `main` that
changes no file, and deciding on content skipped it, which left the next
promotion out of date against a `main` that requires it up to date, with no
merge button (after #381, repaired by hand in #414). Such a pull request carries
no change, and nobody has to read it: it merges on its own.

That pull request merges itself once the required checks pass. It needs no
review verdict, and the reason is a property of its content rather than a
relaxation: it carries the release output a human approved minutes earlier, so a
second reading is ceremony. The exemption is proved rather than granted on the
author alone: the `independent-review` job checks that the head is already on
`main`, or is the clean merge of a `develop` commit and a `main` commit with
nothing else `main` lacks. A commit pushed onto the branch by anyone else sends it
back to needing a verdict. Every other pull request into `develop` waits for the
independent reviewer's verdict on its head. Native auto-merge is used, so
protection and the required checks stand; a failing check simply leaves it open. It opens rather than pushes: `develop` is
protected with `enforce_admins`, and a branch only a robot may bypass is not
protected. A conflict fails the job instead of being resolved unattended, since
it means `develop` and `main` both touched a file release-please owns.

### Promotion cadence: `develop` to `main`

**Promoting publishes nothing.** The `publish` job is gated on `release_created`, which is
only true when the release PR itself is merged. A promotion merely recomputes that PR. So a
promotion costs almost nothing, while a late one costs a diff nobody reads — and the whole
value of the `main` gate is that someone still reads.

That asymmetry sets the rule:

- **Promote when a coherent set of work is green on `develop`.** Coherence is the trigger,
  not the clock. "End of day" can cut a feature in half or bundle three unrelated subjects.
- **Never let a working day pass without promoting.** The clock is the safety net, not the
  trigger. Roughly ten commits is the point where the promotion PR stops being readable.
- **The gate is not "the diff was reviewed".** It is **"the behaviour was validated on
  `develop`"**. Writing down the gate that is actually performed is what keeps it real; a
  gate everyone claims and nobody performs protects nothing.

A `develop` far ahead of `main` is the failure mode this flow is most exposed to. It
reintroduces exactly the unreviewable batch that the sequential autopilot was designed to
eliminate.

## Files that carry a version

The bump script touches **all of these**. Don't edit them by hand.

| File | What it's for |
|---|---|
| `packages/core/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Core plugin manifest. |
| `packages/packs/<pack>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (6 files) | Each pack's plugin manifest. |
| `packages/cli/package.json` | CLI npm package version. |
| `packages/harness-graph/package.json` | harness-graph kernel npm package version. |
| `packages/packs/<pack>/package.json` (pack-monorepo, pack-nextjs) | Runtime npm packages with shipped code. |

`packages/cli/core-assets/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is **generated** at `prepack` time — do not edit.

## The normal flow: exactly two PR merges

Releasing is driven by **release-please** from the Conventional Commits already
enforced here. No one edits a version, dispatches a workflow or approves a job in
Actions on the routine path.

1. `promotion.yml` maintains one `develop -> main` PR and records every promoted
   commit, its first entry on develop's first-parent history, and the merged PR
   whose `mergeCommit` exactly matches that entry, including nested branch PRs.
   A later containing merge cannot authorize an earlier direct commit. Each pull
   request must hold one of the three merge authorities above (a success verdict
   on its head, the named human by hand, or the back-merge proved by
   construction), with fail-closed pagination checks. **Release
   action 1:** merge that promotion PR after its five current checks pass and the
   complete accounting is explainable.
2. On `main`, release-please maintains one version/changelog PR. It changes every
   versioned manifest in lockstep and is opened with the bounded Release App, so
   normal branch-protection checks run. `feat:` gives a minor bump, `fix:` a patch,
   and a breaking change a minor bump before 1.0.
3. **Release action 2:** merge the release-please PR after reading the version and
   changelog and after `validate`, `enforce`, and the three install-conformance
   checks pass. This merge creates `vX.Y.Z` and the GitHub Release. It is the npm
   publication authorization.
4. `validate-release`, with `contents: read` and no OIDC, resolves the immutable
   tag, proves its commit is on protected `main`, validates the exact tree, and
   packs `voidmachine-X.Y.Z.tgz` once. It uploads that tarball plus an integrity
   manifest containing the release identity, SHA-256 and npm SHA-512 integrity.
5. `publish` is the only job with `id-token: write`. It checks the artifact's exact
   GitHub ID, service digest, workflow run and head SHA before download, then
   recomputes every manifest and tarball check. It performs no checkout, install,
   build, test, pack or package lifecycle step. If the version is absent it runs
   `npm publish "$TARBALL_PATH" --access public --ignore-scripts`; if the exact
   version already exists it never attempts an overwrite. Its tested classifier
   distinguishes structured npm errors on stderr, transient failures, missing
   attestations and conflicting bytes, and it requires npm 11.5.1 or newer.
6. `verify-publication`, with no OIDC, environment or package credential, installs
   the exact public version with scripts disabled, runs
   `npm audit signatures --json --include-attestations`, and verifies the npm
   bundle with `gh attestation verify --digest-alg sha512`. The signed subject,
   repository, workflow, `main` ref, workflow head commit, run and attempt must
   all match. A new publish must name the current execution; an existing-version
   retry derives and verifies the original canonical producer from the signed
   bundle instead of pretending the retry signed historical bytes. The separately
   verified artifact manifest binds those bytes to the release commit selected by
   the immutable tag. Registry metadata alone is not success.
7. `back-merge.yml` returns the approved release output to `develop` through
   native auto-merge after the same required checks pass, the one pull request
   the review verdict exempts.

There is no normal-path workflow dispatch, deployment approval, npm token or
manual laptop publish. A green publish without a green `verify-publication` is an
incomplete release, not success.

### Exceptional retry after a failed publication

Recovery is deliberately visible in Actions because it is exceptional. Dispatch
`release.yml` **from `main`** with the required input `release_tag` set to the
existing closed form `vX.Y.Z`. The matching GitHub Release must already exist, its
tag commit must still be reachable from protected `main`, and all versioned
manifests must match `X.Y.Z`.

The retry rebuilds and validates that immutable tree, then follows the same
artifact, registry and provenance gates. It never means "publish whatever main
contains now", never moves a tag, never repairs an old release tree, and never
overwrites a registry version. If npm already contains the exact bytes, the retry
is idempotent only after the same cryptographic verifier passes. Otherwise fix the
cause on `develop` and cut a new version.

### First publish of a package name (one-time bootstrap)

npm Trusted Publishing configures a publisher on an **existing** package only: `npm trust`
states that "the package you're configuring must already exist on the npm registry"
(https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-trust), and the web settings live on the package page.
A new name therefore needs one publication before CI can publish it, and that publication
must not be the release itself: `release.yml` classifies an already-present version as
`existing` and then requires npm provenance on its bytes, which a hand publish never carries.

The name is reserved with a placeholder, then the release goes through CI like any other:

1. From a scratch directory, publish a placeholder `voidmachine@0.0.0` interactively, as a
   maintainer with account-level 2FA: a `package.json` with the name, version `0.0.0` and the
   `repository.url` of this repository, a README saying the package is reserved. Enter the OTP
   when prompted; no token is created or stored.
2. Configure the trusted publisher on it, on npmjs.com (package **Settings → Trusted Publisher →
   GitHub Actions**) or with npm 11.15 or newer:
   `npm trust github voidmachine --file release.yml --repo voidcorp-core/void-machine --env npm-publish`.
   The environment is not optional here: leaving it blank is what made any branch publishable.
3. Merge the release pull request. `publish` finds the version absent, publishes it tokenlessly
   with provenance, and `verify-publication` proves it. `latest` moves off the placeholder.
4. Only then deprecate the former package towards the new one
   (`npm deprecate <former>@"*" "renamed to voidmachine"`), so nobody is pointed at a name
   that has nothing to install yet.

An `E404` on publish is a credential problem, and the credential to suspect first is the one the
workflow injected, not the one npm is missing: `setup-node`'s `registry-url` input once wrote an
`_authToken` line into a temporary `.npmrc`, so npm believed it already had a credential and never
ran the OIDC exchange (actions/setup-node#1551).

## External controls that make the workflow claims true

npm matches organization, repository, workflow filename and optional environment;
it does not match a branch. The workflow is therefore only one layer. Before a
production release, an operator with temporary administrative authority reads
these controls, changes only a mismatching value, then reads it back:

- `main` allows pushes only by `folpe`; the Release App, teams and other users are
  absent. `main` and `develop` keep strict `validate`, `enforce`, and the Ubuntu,
  macOS and Windows install-conformance checks, with admin enforcement and no
  force-push or deletion.
- Repository Actions are enabled with `allowed_actions: selected` and
  `sha_pinning_required: true`. GitHub-owned actions are allowed; the only public
  patterns are `pnpm/action-setup@*` and
  `googleapis/release-please-action@*`. Every effective workflow reference is a
  full commit SHA.
- The Release App installation is selected-repository mode for exactly
  `voidcorp-core/void-machine`. Its ceiling is repository `Contents: write` and
  `Pull requests: write`, plus implicit metadata read. It has no Actions,
  Administration, Environments, Secrets or organization permission.
- One active `v*` ruleset lets only that App create a tag. A second active `v*`
  ruleset blocks tag update and deletion with no bypass. Immutable releases are
  enabled for this repository.
- `npm-publish` accepts only `main`, has no required reviewer and cannot be
  admin-bypassed. Its absence of reviewers is intentional: the release PR merge
  is the second human authorization, so an Actions approval would be a hidden
  third action.
- npm Trusted Publisher is exactly organization `voidcorp-core`, repository
  `void-machine`, workflow `release.yml`, environment `npm-publish`, publish-only.
  Maintainer accounts and the organization use secure 2FA, and no legacy or
  granular token retains publish authority.

Safe read-only audit examples, none of which print a token or App key:

```bash
gh api repos/voidcorp-core/void-machine/branches/main/protection
gh api repos/voidcorp-core/void-machine/actions/permissions
gh api repos/voidcorp-core/void-machine/actions/permissions/selected-actions
gh api --paginate repos/voidcorp-core/void-machine/rulesets
gh api repos/voidcorp-core/void-machine/environments/npm-publish
gh api repos/voidcorp-core/void-machine/immutable-releases
npm trust list voidmachine --json
```

The npm command requires an authenticated npm 11.15 or newer maintainer session;
it never runs in the publishing workflow. Installation-repository pagination and
organization 2FA inspection likewise need owner/admin authority. These checks are
operator-run because storing a standing administrator credential beside a publish
workflow would create a more powerful release path than the one being audited.

### Fail-closed diagnostics

| Diagnostic | Likely cause | Safe correction |
|---|---|---|
| `release tag must match vX.Y.Z` or no matching GitHub Release | The recovery input is malformed, missing, or points at something that was never released. | Dispatch from `main` with the existing immutable tag. Do not substitute a SHA or move/create a tag by hand. |
| `artifact-id`, service digest, workflow run/head, manifest, or tarball digest mismatch | The cross-job artifact is stale, substituted, corrupt, or belongs to another run. | Stop. Preserve the run evidence, discard the artifact, and rerun from the same immutable tag only after identifying the mismatch. |
| `Published version has different bytes` | npm already owns `X.Y.Z` with integrity different from the validated tarball. | Treat as a release integrity incident. Investigate and cut a new version; npm versions are never overwritten. |
| npm signature, Sigstore certificate, workflow/ref/workflow-head/run/attempt, or signed subject mismatch | Public bytes are unattributed, the wrong workflow produced them, or evidence conflicts with this execution. | Treat the published version as unverified. Preserve npm/GitHub evidence, investigate credentials and workflow history, then fix forward with a new version. |

Transient registry errors and delayed attestations are retried only within the
documented bounds. Exhaustion stays red; it is never converted into a successful
publish merely because the version is visible.

Two CI gates fail the build on a drift so a version bump can never ship a stale
artifact: `pnpm version:check` (every manifest at the canonical version) and
`pnpm certification:check` (the frozen `certification.json` matches the model +
its `harnessVersion` stamp). Both the release-please flow (via `extra-files`) and
the manual script bump the certification's `harnessVersion` in lockstep, so a
release never breaks CI on a forgotten regenerate.

Release PRs receive the same five checks as feature PRs, and getting there took
three releases to get right — so the reason is worth keeping.

A pull request opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN` triggers **no workflows**. That is a
deliberate GitHub anti-recursion rule, not a repository setting, and no amount of
permission granting changes it. ("Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
requests" is enabled here and was never the blocker.)

The workflow used to answer that by hand: resolve the single open
`autorelease: pending` PR, dispatch `ci.yml` and `void-enforce.yml` at its exact
head, then approve the `pull_request` runs sitting at `action_required` — because
branch protection reads the checks attached to the PR, and on 2.3.0 both
dispatched runs were green while the PR stayed `BLOCKED`. It also had to scope
the approval to the head SHA rather than the branch (2.4.0: a long-lived release
branch met the quota with never-approved runs from previous cycles) and to poll
rather than sample (2.3.1: `prs_created` turns true before the PR is searchable).

All of it is gone. The release job now mints a token from a **GitHub App**
(`RELEASE_APP_ID` + `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `Contents` and `Pull requests` as
read & write, installed on this repository only) and hands it to release-please.
An App token is not `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so the pull request it opens triggers
workflows normally. The `actions: write` permission went with the dispatch.

`packages/cli/src/lib/release-workflow.test.ts` pins this: the App token is used,
and none of the removed machinery has crept back. A single `GITHUB_TOKEN`
fallback would restore the whole failure silently and would only be noticed at
the next release.

`validate-release` reruns the full release safety suite against the tagged tree.
The OIDC-capable `publish` job deliberately cannot run that repository code; its
defense in depth is artifact service identity plus independent byte verification.

The CI validation lane also runs `self-host sync --mode release-gate` followed
by the strict self-host doctor. It builds the hook runner directly from current
TypeScript with the source checkout's esbuild, compiles and executes a
current-source runtime-adapter worker under the isolated staging boundary,
revalidates the source hash before publication, verifies the deterministic
receipt, executes both hooks, and replays their canonical events. No generated
self-host file is published or committed. Missing Claude/Codex executables are
reported as degraded rather than certified. When present, a bounded `--version`
process smoke receives no ambient credentials. Installation steps emit bounded,
structured start/finish events with their runtime, operation and duration, so an
outer timeout retains the last active step. Consumer suites stop at the first
failed proof; later suites are not launched after that failure. These diagnostics
do not change the 120-second execution limit or authorize a retry.
The install suite performs one offline npm installation of the verified tarball
in a suite-local package directory. Its CLI then exercises three independent
consumer roots (Claude, Codex and both), each with its own environment, receipts
and user files. Package installation is measured separately; runtime p50 covers
init and both update paths only. The package directory is never reused across
runs or operating systems, and all three runtime proofs remain mandatory.
Install conformance and later
runtime-invocation certification remain separate gates.

There is no manual release fallback. `scripts/bump-version.mjs` remains a local
maintenance utility, but repository versions, release tags and npm publication
belong to release-please and the protected chain. A release failure is recovered
with the immutable tag retry above or with a new fix and version.

Consumers on a project pull the new version with:

```bash
void-harness update    # refresh marketplace cache + bump .void/config.json pins
# then restart Claude Code
```

## Package size ceilings

`pnpm check:size` (`scripts/check-package-size.mjs`, run in CI beside `check:publish`) packs every
publishable package with `pnpm pack` and fails when a compressed tarball exceeds its declared
ceiling. The compressed tarball is what a consumer downloads on `npx voidmachine`; unpacked and
bundle sizes are diagnostics, not budgets. Every size prints on every run, breach or not, so growth
reads as a trajectory rather than a one-day alarm.

Ceilings live in `PACKAGE_LIMITS` in that script, set 2026-08-06 with roughly one sixth of headroom
over the sizes measured then (the CLI 728.2 kB, harness-graph 85.7 kB, packs under 8 kB).

**Raising a ceiling is normal.** Do it in the same commit as the change that needs the room, with
the reason in the commit message, so the growth is a decision on the record rather than a drift
nobody signed. A package published without a ceiling fails the gate: an unbounded package is the one
that grows.

## What counts as breaking

For pre-1.0 we use caret-incompatible semver (`^0.5.x` matches `0.5.*`, not `0.6.*`):

- **Major** (or any minor bump pre-1.0): removes/renames a skill, hook, agent, or manifest field consumers reference. Changes the location of doctrine files. Changes a runtime npm package's public API in a breaking way.
- **Minor**: new skill, new hook, new pack, new runtime export. Additive change to PHILOSOPHY.md.
- **Patch**: skill content edits, hook bugfixes, CLI bugfixes, internal refactors with no consumer-visible API change.

When in doubt, prefer minor over patch — consumers are alerted either way.

## First-bump formatting note

The first run of `bump-version.mjs` normalizes JSON formatting (2-space indent, multi-line arrays). Subsequent bumps touch only the `version` line. Intentional — the script uses `JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)` so we don't carry a hand-tuned formatter just for these manifests.

## Why release-please, not changesets

We chose **release-please**: it derives the bump from Conventional Commits (which
we already enforce), so there is no per-PR ceremony, and its `extra-files` config
bumps all our non-npm manifests (marketplace + 7 plugin.json + mirror) in lockstep
from one canonical version. The release PR keeps a human gate.

[changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) was used earlier for CLI
npm versioning and removed in v0.5.4: its model (independent versions per package,
per-package CHANGELOGs) contradicts the single-number lockstep. If runtime npm
cadence ever splits from marketplace cadence (post-1.0), revisit.

## CHANGELOG

`CHANGELOG.md` is generated and maintained by release-please from the Conventional
Commit history (grouped Features / Bug Fixes). Do not hand-edit it.

## Enforcement at promotion

The separate `void-enforce` workflow judges the complete committed diff against
its target branch. Installation-manifest ownership is a pre-write restriction on
agent tools, not proof that a reviewed installer commit is forbidden. Checked-out
CI evidence retains protected secret/key/credential/Git paths and content scans;
local tool writes retain ownership protection. CI does not certify installer
provenance or human approval of doctrine changes. See the
[committed-evidence decision](decisions-log/2026-09-14-committed-enforcement-ownership--0ee50693-062d-4eb8-b870-840ef6453879.md).

The bounded source reader still requires complete source within 64 KiB. When a
command exceeds it, extract a cohesive module and preserve behavior with tests;
do not raise the ceiling or exempt the command to make promotion green.
