# PROJECT-DOCTRINE.md — the full format

The reference for `.void/PROJECT-DOCTRINE.md`, the file that carries what is true of **your**
project. `void-harness init` seeds that file with a stub of a dozen lines, because it is imported
into every session with `@` and a form nobody has filled in is context that says nothing while
costing what a filled one would. This page is the long form, kept here where nothing loads it.

Universal rules — the ones that hold in any project — live in `.void/installed/PHILOSOPHY.md` and
are managed by the harness; to change one, open an issue on `voidcorp-core/void-machine` through
`void-learn`. Everything below is yours.

**Sections appear as you use them.** There is no order to respect and no section you owe: write
the heading when you have something to put under it, and delete one that stops being true.

The list of section kinds has one owner: the section routing table of `void-learn`
(`packages/core/skills/void-learn/SKILL.md`). This page shows the shape of each kind under the
same name, and adds none. `void-learn` places a rule by meaning: it appends under the heading
your file already has for that kind, whatever its wording, creates the table's name only when no
heading names the kind, and asks you when two headings could hold the rule.

Every example below is an **illustration of the shape**, not a record of anything. Nothing here
happened.

## Project context

Who and what is this codebase for? One or two paragraphs the agent can use
to calibrate decisions.

- **Product** : <what this project is>
- **Users** : <who uses it, how many, in what conditions>
- **What would break** : <the most expensive failure modes>
- **Current phase** : <pilot / scaling / maintenance / etc.>
- **Stable vs in-flight sub-systems** : <list>

(Replace this section with your real project context.)

---

## Domain language

If the team uses specific terms for domain concepts, list them here so the
agent uses the same wording (composes with `void-domain-driven-design`).

| Term | Meaning in this project |
|---|---|
| | |

(Add your domain terms or delete the table if there is no specific
vocabulary to enforce.)

---

## Quality bar

What "done" means on this project, beyond the universal floor in `.void/installed/PHILOSOPHY.md`.
Write only what raises or specializes that floor here.

- **<rule name>** : <what must hold before a change counts as shipped>.
  - **Why** : <what shipping without it cost>.
  - **Enforced by** : <gate / skill / manual review>.

(Add your own bar or delete if the universal floor is enough.)

---

## Trade-offs already decided

The agent MUST NOT re-litigate these. Each entry points to the rationale
in its own file under `docs/decisions/` (or equivalent) so future contributors can audit
the choice without paging the original team.

- `docs/decisions/<date>-<slug>--<id>.md` — <one-line summary of the decision>
- ...

(Add your decisions as they happen.)

---

## Hard rules

Rules that apply HERE only — usually because of a specific dependency,
incident, regulation, or domain constraint. If a rule is universal,
it belongs in `.void/installed/PHILOSOPHY.md`, not here.

Format per rule:

- **<rule name>** : <verbatim wording>.
  - **Why** : <reason — incident, regulation, dependency quirk>.
  - **Enforced by** : <skill / hook / manual review / code-review skill>.

Shape of a rule, with a plausible one to show what each line carries:

- **Stripe webhook signature verification** : every Stripe webhook handler
  verifies the signature AND the timestamp window (≤ 5 minutes).
  - **Why** : the incident that made it a rule — a replayed webhook
    re-credited an account. Composes with `void-async-safety`.
  - **Enforced by** : `withWebhookSafety` wrapper from
    `@voidcorp/pack-nextjs/async` + code review.

---

## Open questions

Things the team has not yet decided. Useful for the agent so it asks
instead of guessing.

- <open question> — owner: <person>, deadline: <date>
- ...

(Add as they come up. Move one to "Trade-offs already decided" once the
ADR is written.)

---

## Project-specific skill routing

Override default skill behavior for THIS project.

Examples:

- **Strict TDD on payment surface** : any change to `apps/checkout/` or
  `apps/billing/` triggers `void-tdd` in **strict** mode even if the
  path heuristic would say souple.
- **LLM-cost gate on agent calls** : any LLM call in `apps/agents/` must
  include `// using <model> because <why>` if it uses Opus —
  composes with `void-llm-cost-discipline`.

(Add your own routing overrides or delete if no project-specific routing
is required.)

---

## Forbidden patterns

Things THIS project has paid for and will never reintroduce. Universal
anti-patterns (DI containers, CQRS default, raw `process.env`, etc.) are
already in `.void/installed/PHILOSOPHY.md` — list here only what is project-local.

- **<pattern>** : do not <action> in `<path>`.
  - **Why** : <incident / ADR>.
  - **Replacement** : <what to do instead>.

(Add your own as incidents happen, or delete if not applicable.)
