# Decisions log

Non-obvious decisions taken on the harness itself, where a credible alternative
existed. One entry per decision. Newest first. See CLAUDE.md meta-rules.

## 2026-06-01: pack peer deps use `workspace:^`, not `workspace:*` or a literal range

Context: `pack-nextjs` peer-depends on `pack-monorepo`. With `workspace:*`, pnpm
publishes the EXACT version (`0.5.4`); `npm pack` (which does not understand the
workspace protocol) would leak `workspace:*` verbatim into the tarball.

Decision: use `workspace:^`. pnpm publish/pack converts it to `^<version>`
(`^0.5.4`), a lockstep-compatible range, and it auto-tracks the version. Publish
must go through pnpm (RELEASING.md: `pnpm -r publish`), never `npm publish`.

Alternative rejected: a literal `^0.5.4`. `scripts/bump-version.mjs` only rewrites
each package's own `version`, not peer-dependency ranges, so a literal would go
stale at the next bump. `workspace:^` needs no manual upkeep.

## 2026-06-01: .void/config.json pins marketplace plugins, not npm packages

Context: the `packs` field in `.void/config.json` is written by `init` as
`@voidcorp/<plugin-name>` (e.g. `@voidcorp/void-nextjs`) and read back by
`doctor` in the same shape. The docs example instead showed `@voidcorp/pack-nextjs`
(the npm package name), mixing two vocabularies for the same field.

Decision: the field pins marketplace plugins (what `doctor` compares against the
marketplace HEAD), keyed `@voidcorp/<plugin-name>`. Docs were aligned to the
runtime; the schema was left unchanged to avoid breaking existing consumer
configs. The npm package names (`@voidcorp/pack-<stack>`) are a separate concern
(runtime `import`s), documented as such.

Alternative rejected: rekey the field to npm package names. That would require
changing init + doctor in lockstep and would break any `.void/config.json`
already written in consumer projects, for no functional gain (doctor needs the
plugin identity, not the npm name).

## 2026-06-01: em dash / emoji rule softened (no purge, no gate)

Context: the hard rule "No em dashes, no emojis in code/docs/commits" was
contradicted by the corpus itself: 254 tracked files contain em dashes, mostly
deliberate typographic separators in skill prose, and the render layer uses an
em dash glyph as data. CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md violated their own rule.

Decision: soften the rule to target intent (no AI-slop filler) while allowing
em dashes and emojis where they carry meaning. No repo-wide purge, no CI gate.

Alternatives rejected:
- Purge all 254 files and add a global grep gate: enormous diff, rewrites the
  authored style of every skill, and would still need an allowlist for the
  render glyph. Cost far exceeds the benefit.
- Drop the rule entirely: loses the original intent (keeping AI-slop out of
  newly written prose and commits).

## 2026-06-01: Biome as the linter (over ESLint)

Context: the root `lint` script fanned out to per-package `lint` scripts that
did not exist, so `pnpm lint` printed "None of the selected packages has a lint
script" and exited 0. A quality harness shipped with a gate that gated nothing.

Decision: adopt Biome (`@biomejs/biome`) as the single linter. Root `lint`
script is `biome lint`; config lives in `biome.json`, scoped to first-party
TypeScript (`packages/**/src`, config files, `test/`) and excluding `dist`,
`node_modules`, `templates`, and `*.d.ts`. A CI step runs `pnpm lint`.

Alternatives considered:
- ESLint + typescript-eslint: more rules and plugins, but heavier install,
  slower, and needs a flat-config plus parser wiring. Overkill for a small CLI.
- Keep the fan-out and add per-package ESLint: more moving parts, same result.

Why Biome won: single binary, near-zero config, fast, and the hooks already
treat both `biome` and `eslint.config` as known toolchain markers. The formatter
is left disabled in the gate (`biome lint`, not `biome check`) so the gate
enforces correctness without forcing a repo-wide reformat.

## 2026-06-01: jq is a hard runtime dependency, surfaced by doctor

Context: 15 of the 20 hooks parse the Claude Code tool-call JSON from stdin with
jq. On a machine without jq the hooks fail open and silently stop enforcing.

Decision: `void-harness doctor` now checks for jq alongside gh, with an install
hint. jq stays an external dependency (not bundled): it is ubiquitous and
bundling a binary per platform is not worth the weight.
