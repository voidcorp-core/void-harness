// Release safety: keep the published tarballs inside a declared ceiling.
//
// This gate does not make anything smaller. It exists because nothing was
// watching: weight arrives one legitimate feature at a time, and without a
// ceiling the first time anyone notices is after it is on npm. A number that is
// measured every run and bounded on purpose is the difference between a size
// budget and a size surprise.
//
// It measures `pnpm pack`, not `npm pack`, because pnpm is what RELEASING.md
// mandates and therefore what consumers actually download — and because pnpm
// rewrites `workspace:` specifiers at pack time, so a pnpm tarball is the only
// faithful one (see check-publish-safety.mjs, which packs the same way).
//
// The compressed tarball is the only figure a ceiling belongs on: it is what
// crosses the network on `npx voidharness`. Unpacked size and bundle size are
// interesting, but nobody waits on them.
//
// Raising a ceiling is a normal thing to do. Do it in the same commit as the
// change that needs it, with the reason in the commit message, so the growth is
// a decision on the record rather than a drift nobody signed.
