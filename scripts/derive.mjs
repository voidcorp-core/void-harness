// Regenerate everything this repository derives from its own assets.
//
// Repository projections are generated from skills, agents, hooks, commands,
// packs and the verification catalogue. They include the graph catalogue and
// compatibility model, certification manifest, consumer bundle, cheat sheet,
// npm mirror, skill-reference register and CI gate block. Each once had its own
// build command or hand-maintained copy, and nothing declared the complete set.
//
// The cost of that showed up the day thirteen skills were renamed: the gates
// fired one at a time, in series, each after a push, and a late artefact was
// found by CI rather than by the commit that caused it. Enumerating output paths
// does not fix this: the next projection would still be omitted.
//
// So the check here is not a list. It derives, then asserts the working tree is
// unchanged. Anything generated is covered the day it is added, without anyone
// remembering to say so.
//
// Usage: node scripts/derive.mjs [--check]
