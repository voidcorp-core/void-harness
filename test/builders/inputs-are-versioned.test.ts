/**
 * A build must not read anything that belongs to the machine running it.
 *
 * Learned twice on 2026-08-19. `prepare-data.ts` read `.void/runs` -- the mission
 * journals of whoever ran the build -- and inlined the result into the studio,
 * itself inlined into `void-graph.mjs`, which is committed and published to npm.
 * The package therefore carried that person's real activity, and differed on
 * every build since a journal grows with every session. Hours later, a test run
 * with the locally built CLI wrote a bundle compiled from the working tree into
 * `.void/hooks/`, where only the published one belongs.
 *
 * `derive:check` could not see the first: `scripts/derive.mjs` deliberately
 * excludes `void-graph.mjs` from byte comparison, because a vite/esbuild bundle
 * is not guaranteed identical across toolchain versions. The exception is sound;
 * the hole was that nothing else looked.
 *
 * Checking the OUTPUT would mean building twice on every CI run, for ever.
 * Checking the INPUTS costs nothing and names the cause: a builder reads
 * versioned files, and nothing else.
