/**
 * A skill is agnostic. Its frontmatter carries nothing this harness invented.
 *
 * The Agent Skills specification defines six fields, and the official validator
 * refuses everything else:
 *
 *     $ npx skills-ref validate packages/core/skills/tdd
 *     Unexpected fields in frontmatter: activation, enforcement, eval_targets,
 *     kind, owner, runtimes. Only allowed-tools, compatibility, description,
 *     license, metadata, name are allowed.
 *
 * Seven fields were ours: `kind`, `owner`, `runtimes`, `enforcement`,
 * `eval_targets`, `activation`, `triggers`. None is read by any runtime — they
 * feed this repository's own graph, and `runtimes` additionally tells the
 * installer which skills go to Codex. A skill exported anywhere else carried
 * them for nothing, and failed validation because of them.
 *
 * They now live in a co-located `harness.yaml`, excluded from what a consumer
 * receives exactly as `.source` already is. So the installed SKILL.md is byte
 * for byte the source, and the source is portable.
 *
 * Two Claude Code-specific fields were dropped rather than moved.
 * `disable-model-invocation` only ever worked on one runtime out of three, so it
 * guaranteed nothing while looking like it did; the skills that used it say
 * "only when a human asks" in their first section, and loading a skill is not
 * running it. `when_to_use` folds into `description`, which the spec already
 * asks to say both what a skill does and when to use it.
