/**
 * A ticket written without looking is a ticket written twice.
 *
 * On 2026-08-06 DEV-591 was created about an unstable test suite while DEV-561
 * had covered the same subject since 2026-08-03, at high priority. The two share
 * no word in their titles -- "suite de tests instable" against "contention des
 * tests" -- so searching the phrasing would have found nothing, and searching the
 * subject would have found it immediately.
 *
 * The expensive half was not the duplicate. DEV-561 carried an explicit finding:
 * an intermittent test is a question nobody has answered, not noise to isolate.
 * DEV-591 recommended precisely what DEV-561 forbade, because nobody read it.
 *
 * These clauses decay the same way every process step does: they get compressed
 * into "check for duplicates", which reads as advice and changes nothing.
