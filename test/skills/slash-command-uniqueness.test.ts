/**
 * A gesture is a skill. There is no second format.
 *
 * Claude Code answers `/<name>` from a skill and from a `commands/<name>.md` file
 * alike, and its own documentation states the two were merged: "Custom commands
 * have been merged into skills [...] both create `/deploy` and work the same
 * way." Skills add what commands never had - a directory for supporting files,
 * `paths`, `disable-model-invocation` - and, decisively here, they are the only
 * format Codex and Kimi understand at all. A command is staged to
 * `.claude/commands/` and nowhere else, so every gesture living there was
 * Claude-only by construction.
 *
 * Keeping both formats also produced the defect that started this: `/void-checkpoint`
 * existed as command and as skill, each with its own description, and the two had
 * drifted into advertising different jobs for one gesture.
 *
 * So the rule is not "one name, one owner" any more. It is stronger and simpler:
 * no shipped surface has a `commands/` directory.
