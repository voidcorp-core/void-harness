/**
 * Six defects shipped on 2026-08-06 with typecheck, lint, 2,700 tests and five CI
 * checks green. What caught them: the agent using the thing on the real
 * repository, five times; the harness itself once. The human merge gate caught
 * none, and CI caught none.
 *
 * One announced "5 path(s) not extracted (... 2 unresolved-import)" about two
 * files it had read, parsed and indexed -- the exact lie the feature existed to
 * prevent -- and it was found by running the command on the repo, after merge.
 *
 * So the pass does not ask whether the tests pass. It asks whether anyone ran
 * the thing and read what came back, which is a different question, and the only
 * one that had a hit rate.
