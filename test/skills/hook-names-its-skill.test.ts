/**
 * A refusal must say which doctrine it is enforcing.
 *
 * Thirteen PreToolUse rules refuse writes in this harness, and they refused
 * anonymously: "any weakens the type boundary" names the rule and not the skill
 * that explains it. So the enforcement layer worked while the doctrine layer sat
 * unread, which is exactly the shape of the failure this whole chantier is about.
 * Over the observed telemetry there were 26,440 hook executions and 4 skill
 * activations.
 *
 * Naming the skill in the refusal is the cheapest possible fix: one line, no
 * automatic loading, and the model reaches for the skill only if it needs more
 * than the rule. That is the progressive disclosure the Agent Skills spec asks
 * for, and unlike `paths` it works identically on Claude and Codex, since both
 * run the same hook runner.
 *
 * The association is not invented here. `relations.graph.yaml` already declares
 * 24 `enforces` edges from a hook to the skill it enforces, with evidence. This
 * test holds the runner's table to that declaration, so the two cannot drift.
