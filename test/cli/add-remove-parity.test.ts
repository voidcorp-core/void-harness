/**
 * One real `init` for the file, copied by the test that only needs its result.
 *
 * `init` writes 71 owned files and costs about a second on an idle machine. The
 * test below spends that on a precondition -- what it is about is `add` and
 * `remove` over a real installation -- and under the full concurrent suite the
 * three together were cut at the 10 s budget about two runs in five. Copying the
 * installed project costs roughly a tenth of that, and the copy IS an `init`
 * output, so nothing the test reads became a fixture written by hand.
 *
 * Built before any test and never written to, so no test depends on another
 * having run. The test that asserts on `init`'s own output still calls it.
 *
 * What that did NOT close, measured rather than assumed. `materializes and
 * removes only receipt-owned local pack assets` still fails about one full suite
 * in three. Per phase on an idle machine: the fixture copy 29 ms over 72 files
 * and 733 KB, `add` 691 ms, `remove` 434 ms. So the precondition is already ~2%
 * of the cost and there is nothing left to trim there -- `add` on a locally
 * installed project runs a whole `init` (`addLocalPacks` -> `init`), `remove`
 * does the same, and those two calls ARE what the test asserts on.
 *
 * The residual is contention, not redundant work: 693 ms isolated becomes
 * 5576 ms against the 10 s budget under the full concurrent suite, and the
 * neighbouring `init` test 365 ms becomes 3961 ms. Both sit within a factor of
 * two of the ceiling, so any extra load tips one over. The remaining levers are
 * a sequential lane for the install-heavy files, or `add` / `remove` not
 * re-running a full `init` -- a change to the suite's execution shape or to the
 * install path this repository runs on itself. Each wants its own ticket, and
 * neither is a bigger budget.
