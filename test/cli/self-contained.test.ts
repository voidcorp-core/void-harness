/**
 * The published CLI must run from its tarball alone.
 *
 * `npx voidharness` is the primary install channel, and the offline install
 * conformance in CI proves the tarball extracts and runs with no registry. That
 * gate is slow and platform-matrixed; this one is instant and says why.
 *
 * The failure it catches is easy to cause and easy to miss: adding a runtime
 * dependency instead of bundling it. Everything the CLI needs is inlined by
 * tsup's `noExternal`, so its `dependencies` map stays empty by construction.
