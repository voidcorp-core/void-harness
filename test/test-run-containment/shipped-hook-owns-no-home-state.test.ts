/**
 * The shipped hook bundle must not write into the operator's home directory.
 *
 * `registerProjectRoot` wrote one pointer per project root into
 * `~/.void/projects` on every hook invocation. Exercised against temporary roots
 * it accumulated 15 997 pointers by 2026-08-17 and **54 853** by 2026-09-04 on
 * this machine — measured, not estimated. The registry it fed was replaced by
 * marker discovery, which finds every installed project without any prior
 * registration, so the writes bought nothing at all.
 *
 * The sibling test in this directory proves the Vitest process is contained.
 * That is not the same claim: it protects THIS repository's runs, while the
 * defect ships to consumers inside the hook bundle. Version 3.6.0 is published
 * with `registerProjectRoot` still in it — verified by unpacking the tarball —
 * which is exactly the gap a containment check on our own process cannot see.
 *
 * So this holds the artifact, not the run. A hook may read the home directory;
 * writing durable state there is the operator's disk, and nothing in a hook has
 * earned it.
