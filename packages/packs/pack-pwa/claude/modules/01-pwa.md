# Progressive Web App (`@voidcorp/pack-pwa`)

PWA conventions for offline-first apps. Stack-agnostic — works with Next.js, Vite, Astro. For mobile-app conventions (Expo/React Native) see `@voidcorp/pack-mobile`.

## Required artifacts

```

```

`manifest.webmanifest` is the authoritative metadata; do **not** also keep a stale `manifest.json`.

## Service worker

- Prefer **Serwist** (modern Workbox successor) for Next.js, **vite-plugin-pwa** for Vite.
- Strategies:
  - HTML pages: `NetworkFirst` with 3s timeout, fallback to cache
  - Static assets (JS/CSS/fonts): `CacheFirst`
  - API calls: `NetworkOnly` by default; opt-in `NetworkFirst` for tolerable reads
- Versioning: include a build hash in cache names so old workers expire correctly.

## Offline-first data

The Solaar pattern: every write goes through a **capture queue** (IndexedDB) and a **sync engine**:

```
UI write → captureQueue.enqueue(intent) → optimistic update → sync()
                                                                 ↓
                                                       server (Server Action)
```

- `captureQueue` persists intents in IndexedDB with idempotency keys.
- `sync()` retries with exponential backoff, marks intents as committed/failed.
- Conflict resolution: server is source of truth; local optimistic state is overwritten on conflict.

This pack ships `@voidcorp/pack-pwa/offline` exporting `captureQueue`, `sync`, `useOfflineMutation`.

## Install prompt UX

- Do not auto-prompt on first visit (sketchy). Wait for a meaningful engagement signal (≥ 2 sessions OR ≥ 30s in-app).
- Honor `beforeinstallprompt` event; capture and defer.
- Provide an explicit "Install" button in the app menu.

## Composition

- `void-react` — components subscribe to capture-queue state via hooks.
- `void-server` — Server Actions are the sync target; their idempotency-key handling pairs with capture-queue keys.
- `void-nextjs` — Serwist plugin in `next.config.ts`, manifest in `app/manifest.ts`.
- `void:async-safety` — sync engine retries are bounded, dead-letter routing on permanent failure.
