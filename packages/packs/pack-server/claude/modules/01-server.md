# Server-side conventions (`@voidcorp/pack-server`)

This pack covers the server trust boundary: Server Actions, webhook handlers, scheduled / background jobs, Drizzle migrations. It is **stack-agnostic** — works in Next.js, Hono, standalone Bun/Node servers.

## Trust boundaries are sacred

Every endpoint that receives data from outside the process is a **trust boundary**. Apply at every one:

1. **Auth** — verify session before doing anything else
2. **Zod ingress** — schema validates the input object (no untyped `formData.get()`)
3. **Rate limit** — per-user or per-IP (see `void-rate-limit-strategy`)
4. **Observability** — trace ID + Sentry user scope (hashed)
5. **Service call** — pure domain logic in `src/services/`

The skill `void-server-action` ships the executable pattern for these layers; this module is the orientation reference.

## Webhook handlers

Live at `apps/<app>/src/app/api/webhooks/<source>/route.ts`. The 5-layer pattern (signature verification, idempotency, Zod re-validation, service call, ack) is documented in `void-webhook-handler-pattern` with per-source examples (Stripe, Resend, GitHub, custom HMAC).

No wrapper required — the pattern is short enough to inline. If your project repeats it 3+ times, DRY into a project-side helper.

## Background jobs

- Event-driven: Inngest / Trigger.dev / Cloudflare Queues
- Scheduled: Vercel Cron / Inngest schedule
- Pattern: `void-background-job-pattern` (5 layers: validate / idempotent / observable / work / classify retries)

## Drizzle migrations safety

- Migrations live at `apps/<app>/db/migrations/` (Drizzle default).
- New columns: NULL or DEFAULT first, then backfill, then NOT NULL (no exclusive locks on prod tables).
- Index creation: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` on Postgres.
- Composes with `void-migrations` (generic) + `void-drizzle-migration-safe` (Drizzle-specific).

## Server Actions vs route handlers

| Use case | Layer |
|---|---|
| UI mutation triggered by a button/form | Server Action (`app/(actions)/`) |
| External system POSTs (webhook) | Route handler (`api/webhooks/`) — see `void-webhook-handler-pattern` |
| Public read-only API | Route handler (`api/`) |
| Internal cron / queue job | Route handler + auth via secret — see `void-background-job-pattern` |

## Composition (informational)

- `harness-react` — components call Server Actions, not the DB.
- `harness-nextjs` — Server Actions in `app/(actions)/`, webhooks in `app/api/webhooks/`.
- `void-async-safety` — generic retry/idempotency/dead-letter doctrine.
- `void-security-guidance` — Zod at ingress, no PII in returned errors.
- `void-observability` — trace + Sentry on every handler.
