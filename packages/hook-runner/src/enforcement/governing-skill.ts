/**
 * Which skill explains the rule a refusal just applied.
 *
 * A hook that refuses anonymously teaches nothing: the write is blocked, the
 * reason is one sentence, and the doctrine that would prevent the next one stays
 * unopened. The measured shape of that was 26,440 hook executions against 4 skill
 * activations in the same telemetry.
 *
 * Naming the skill costs one line and loads nothing. The model reads the name and
 * reaches for the skill only when the sentence is not enough, which is the
 * progressive disclosure the Agent Skills spec describes. It also works the same
 * on Claude and Codex, since both run this runner; `paths`, the Claude-only
 * frontmatter field, only ever *narrows* automatic activation and cannot make one
 * happen.
 *
 * The pairs are declared in `packages/harness-graph/relations.graph.yaml` as
 * `enforces` edges with their evidence. This table is the copy that ships inside
 * the compiled hook, and a test holds the two together so they cannot drift.
