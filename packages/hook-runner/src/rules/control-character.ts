 * made the test file itself unreadable to the extractor it was testing. Neither
 * was blocked, and neither was visible.
 *
 * The cost is not cosmetic. A source file holding a NUL is excluded from
 * indexing, so it drops out of the project graph entirely -- its imports, its
 * symbols and its tests stop existing for every query, and nothing says so.
 *
 * It refuses rather than strips. Rewriting the content silently would leave the
 * author believing they wrote what they read, which is the failure mode again
 * with an extra step.
