// Who owns each path the harness materializes, and therefore what git does with it.
//
// The problem this solves is not cosmetic. `.void/` held two things with
// opposite lifecycles — what the project DECLARES (config.json,
// PROJECT-DOCTRINE.md: authored, reviewed, pushed) and what the harness OBSERVES
// (telemetry, run journals, caches: machine-local, never shipped) — and nothing
// separated them, so every project improvised its own ignore rule over a vacuum.
// The one that prompted this read:
//
//     .void/*
//     !.void/PROJECT-DOCTRINE.md
//
// It rescued the doctrine and silently ignored `config.json` with it — the file
// carrying the pack pins and `paths.business`, the glob the enforcement runner
// reads to decide what the TDD guard covers. A teammate cloning that repo got the
// doctrine and no enforcement configuration, with nothing reporting it.
//
// The fix is a classification, not a longer exception list:
//
//   project   the project authors it, the harness never overwrites it, it ships
//   derived   re-materialized by `init` from the harness assets
//   observed  machine-local history, meaningless in another checkout
//
// Observed state moves under `.void/local/`, so its ignore rule is one line with
// no `!` and — the property that actually matters — stops needing maintenance: a
// new runtime artifact is born inside `local/` and no ignore file learns about it.
//
// `derived` is ignored too, EXCEPT what a fresh clone needs to work: the runner
// `.claude/settings.json` names, and the Codex safety floor. And it is ignored
// PER RECEIPT, never per directory — `.claude/skills/` also holds skills the
// project wrote by hand, and inferring ownership from the folder would ignore
// them and let `--untrack-derived` drop them from the index.
//
// Pure except for the three functions documented as touching the filesystem.
