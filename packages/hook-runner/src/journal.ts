/**
 * Read the mission journals of a project.
 *
 * Both locations, never one: a project whose installed harness predates the
 * `machine/` split keeps writing to `.void/runs` while its older history sits
 * under `.void/machine/runs`. Reading whichever exists first returns half a
 * story in either direction, which is exactly how a guardrail ends up calling a
 * live harness dead. The half-migrated state is a real defect, and `doctor`
 * reports it as one (the `void layout` check); a reader that silently dropped
 * half the evidence would not fix it, only hide it.
 *
 * Discovery is bounded and refuses symlinks, so local telemetry cannot turn this
 * read into an arbitrary file read.
