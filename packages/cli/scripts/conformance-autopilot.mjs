// Does autopilot exist for someone who installed the package?
//
// Every other proof in this repository runs against the monorepo: the skill is
// read from `packages/core`, the command from `src/commands`, the workflow from
// a path that only exists here. All of it can be green while the published
// tarball ships none of it — a source-only success is exactly the false green
// this script exists to catch.
//
// So it receives the exact packed artifact, installs it into a throwaway project, and asks the
// consumer would: is the skill there for my runtime, is the command routed, does
// the CLI compute without a network, and is the retired surface really gone. It
// asserts on the INSTALLED tree, never on this repository.
//
// It contacts nothing. `autopilot plan` is pure computation over stdin, which is
// what makes a consumer-side proof possible at all without a tracker.
