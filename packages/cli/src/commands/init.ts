// `void-harness init` — wire the current project to the void-harness Claude
// Code marketplace and activate the requested plugins.
//
// What this command does (idempotent):
//   1. Create .void/config.json (paths, commands, modes)
//   2. Copy PHILOSOPHY.md into .void/installed/ (managed, restorable)
//   3. Seed .void/PROJECT-DOCTRINE.md from the template, or refresh it while
//      the project has still never written into it
//   4. Merge `.claude/settings.json` with `extraKnownMarketplaces.void-harness`
//      pointing to the GitHub repo, and `enabledPlugins` for the chosen packs
//   5. Patch CLAUDE.md (and its Codex sister AGENTS.md) with the void-harness
//      block (doctrine imports + skill summary)
//
// This command does NOT copy skills/agents/hooks — Claude Code fetches the
// plugin from the marketplace on session start. Skills appear as
// /harness:void-tdd, /harness-nextjs:..., etc.

 * checkout can therefore revert. They used to live in a marked block inside the
 * project's `.gitignore`; that file is tracked, so the protection was
 * branch-dependent while the assets it protects are not, and switching to a
 * branch cut before the install left the whole harness exposed to the next
 * `git clean`.
 *
 * The exclude is written against the PROJECT root, not the stage: it is git
 * metadata living outside the mirror the transaction publishes, it is per-clone,
 * and it is therefore recorded in no manifest -- there is nothing for another
 * checkout to restore, since each one writes its own.
 *
 * The `.gitignore` is edited in the STAGE, so removing the old block travels
 * through the same transaction as everything else and rolls back with it.
