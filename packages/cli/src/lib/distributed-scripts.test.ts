// Every `.js` this repo installs into a consumer project lands in their lint.
//
// The autopilot workflow script is valid for the Workflow engine and invalid
// for a standard JavaScript parser: it carries `export const meta` (so a parser
// reads it as an ES module) alongside a top-level `return` (which no ES module
// may contain). The engine's contract comes from Claude Code, not from here, so
// the file cannot simply be rewritten — but its cost must not land silently on
// every consumer's `lint` script.
//
// This test does two things: it pins the exact set of files that carry the
// contradiction, and it fails when a new one appears. Adding one is then a
// decision somebody makes on purpose, with the consumer-side exclusion in mind,
// rather than a defect discovered three files into someone else's afternoon.
