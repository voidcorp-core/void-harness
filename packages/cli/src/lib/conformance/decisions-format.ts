// The first conformance rule: decisions must live one per file.
//
// Measured across the real park on 2026-08-17: 294 of 426 decisions sit in a
// monolithic `docs/DECISIONS.md`, the format this repo itself abandoned. A
// 1824-line file holding 134 decisions is write-only memory — you cannot find
// one, you cannot see what supersedes what, and nothing stops a past decision
// being quietly rewritten.
//
// DETECTION KEYS ON THE FROZEN MARKER, never on a count. This repo carries 96
// monolith entries against 132 per-file records: counting would say drift where
// there is none, while the header settles it in one line. A monolith that
// declares itself frozen and points at the directory is conformant.
//
// The repair MOVES content, it never rewrites it. An 80-file diff can then be
// checked by comparison instead of by reading, which is the only way a migration
// that size is reviewable at all.
//
// Pure. The caller reads the files and supplies the dates.
