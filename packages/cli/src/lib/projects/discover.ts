// A project is any directory carrying `.void/config.json`. There is deliberately
// NO registry: a registry is mutable global state that rots — moved paths,
// deleted repos, entries nobody remembers to add — and every stale entry has to
// be explained to whoever reads the view. The marker cannot go stale, and a new
// project appears without anyone registering it.
//
// Failure is per-path, never global: this feeds a view that reads the whole
// park at once, so one unreadable directory reports itself and the rest still
// answers.
