// A fingerprint of the Git state every worker of a repository shares.
//
// A worktree isolates the working tree, the index and HEAD, and nothing else.
// The local config (with every file it includes), the stash, tags, notes,
// remotes, the local refs of the base branches, replacement refs, and the hooks
// and info directories of the common Git directory are one set for the whole
// repository. A unit that wrote there changed what every neighbour runs against,
// whatever its own diff looks like (DEV-858). The loop fingerprints that set
// before a unit starts and refuses to publish the unit if it changed.
//
// Digests only, never content: the local config can hold a credential in a
// remote URL, and a record that kept it would carry it to disk. Pure: hashing is
// deterministic and touches nothing; reading git is the adapter's job.
