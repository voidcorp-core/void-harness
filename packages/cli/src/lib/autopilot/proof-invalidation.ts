// When a proof stops proving anything.
//
// A verification is a claim about a specific tree: this command, on this
// integration SHA, over this diff. Change any of the three and the claim is
// about something that no longer exists. Reusing it is how a run publishes a
// branch whose suite was last green before a rebase.
//
// So proofs are bound, not stored. Every one carries the integration SHA it ran
// against, a hash of the diff it covered, and the exact argv. Freshness is
// recomputed rather than remembered, because a stale flag is itself a thing
// that can go stale.
//
// Bias: anything unrecognised is stale. A proof wrongly re-run costs minutes; a
// stale proof wrongly trusted costs the guarantee the whole range exists for.
