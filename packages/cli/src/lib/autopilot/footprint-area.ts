// How one declared area is read, for every step that reads one.
//
// A footprint area is written by a human in a ticket, so all three forms appear
// there: the exact path, the directory that contains a file, and the glob. Two
// steps consume them and they disagreed: `worker-order` compared areas by exact
// string equality to decide who runs in parallel, `footprint-audit` matched by
// prefix and glob to decide whose file is whose. So `packages/cli/src` and
// `packages/cli/src/lib/x.ts` were never sequenced, ran at once, and the second
// ticket's own neighbouring file was then refused as a breach on behalf of the
// first. One relation, read once, is the fix -- not two readings kept in step by
// review.
//
// Normalisation is the other half, and it was a silent guard failure rather than
// a cosmetic one. `packages/core/templates/` -- the most natural way to write a
// directory in a path list -- claimed nothing: not the exact path, not the
// prefix (which would need a doubled slash), and picomatch matches no file
// against a trailing slash either. A file stolen from that area came back
// `within-scope`, reported as a widening, which is the audit's word for
// approval. A leading `./` does the same thing.
//
// An area that still claims nothing after normalisation is refused rather than
// accepted as an empty claim, because an empty claim is indistinguishable from a
// clean audit -- the failure this whole module exists to remove.

 *
 * Asking whether one area claims the other's NAME is not asking whether their
 * files intersect, and for a glob the two questions come apart. An extension
 * glob matches no bare directory, so `packages/**\/*.test.ts` and
 * `packages/core/b` -- "add tests across the packages" beside "refactor
 * packages/core/b", the shape an estimator writes -- read as disjoint and ran
 * at once, while the audit was willing to read both claims on
 * `packages/core/b/x.test.ts` and call it a draw. That leniency is justified by
 * THIS step having sequenced them, so the pair it cannot see is the one that
 * arrives unrefused and unreported.
 *
 * So a pair separates only when it is PROVEN to: every file an area claims lies
 * under its `reach`, and two reaches neither of which contains the other can
 * hold no file in common. Anything else takes its turn. That gives up a lane on
 * two globs rooted in the same subtree that a wider comparison would keep --
 * `packages/core/**\/*.md` beside `packages/core/src/**\/*.ts` -- and gives up
 * every lane to an area rooted at the repository, which is honest about what a
 * repository-wide glob claims. Two areas in different directories, which is
 * how a cluster is normally scoped, are untouched.
 *
 * This subsumes the name reading rather than sitting beside it. An area whose
 * name `areaClaims` claims lies under the claimant's reach, and its own reach
 * is a prefix of its name, so the two reaches are prefixes of one path and
 * always nest -- testing the name again could refuse nothing more. The
 * guarantee that matters is that every pair the audit can relate is a pair this
 * sequences, and that is asserted over a corpus in the tests rather than
 * restated as a branch no input can reach.
