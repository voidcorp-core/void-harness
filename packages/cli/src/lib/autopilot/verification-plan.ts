//
// Every command runs as argv with `shell:false`. Not as a precaution: a verify
// command comes from the project's own ACTIVE.md, and a shell would turn a path
// with a space into two arguments and a semicolon into a second command. argv
// removes the class rather than escaping it.
//
// Output and duration are bounded. A test suite that loops does not get to
// consume the run's memory before someone notices, and a truncated tail is
// still enough to see which command hung.
//
// This module PLANS and JUDGES; it does not spawn. The skill executes and
// reports back, which keeps the decision testable without a process.
