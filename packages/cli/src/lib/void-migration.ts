// cheap, but silently clobbering a run journal that a reconciliation is reading
// is not.

// should commit. `untrackDerived` is the one git-touching function here, and it
// runs only behind an explicit `--untrack-derived` — rewriting someone's index is
// their call, not a side effect of updating.
