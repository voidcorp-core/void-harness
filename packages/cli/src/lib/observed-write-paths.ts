// Is every path the harness WRITES observed state to actually ignored by git?
//
// The neighbouring `void ignore` check asks one question — is `.void/machine/`
// ignored — and a project can answer yes while leaking, because the harness does
// not only write there. The published hook bundle a project still runs writes to
// `.void/outputs/` on every session, and that path was matched by no rule at all:
// a session log sat untracked in this very repo until a `git add .` nearly
// committed it, in a repository that had already committed 2.4 MB of images that
// way. Checking the DECLARED path proves nothing about the ones a shipped bundle
// still uses.
//
// So the candidate list is derived from the layout truth table rather than from
// the ignore block: every observed entry of `VOID_OWNERSHIP`, at the top of
// `.void/` where the older bundles put it, plus the two directory names the
// split introduced. A project on a current harness has none of them on disk and
// hears nothing; a project running an older bundle hears about the exact path
// that bundle writes to.
//
// Two properties this must never lose:
//
//   - a path absent from disk is never reported, or the check fires in every
//     project at once and becomes a report nobody reads;
//   - a path the project is SUPPOSED to commit is never reported, because
//     ignoring `.void/hooks/` or `.codex/hooks.json` breaks every fresh clone.
//
// Deliberately NOT a conformance rule with a repair, though `doctor --fix` was
// the obvious home for it. The admission test in `conformance/rule.ts` asks
// whether two competent people would agree on the exact repair without
// discussing it, and here they would not: the right move is either to migrate a
// legacy directory under `machine/` (a move, which the mutation model cannot
// express, since it writes file contents) or to add an ignore line where it is,
// and choosing between them arbitrates. Worse, appending a line cannot be
// trusted to work: the leak may come from a negation in a nested `.gitignore`,
// in which case a root-level append leaves the leak in place while the repair
// reports success. A repair whose effect cannot be read from its own mutation
// has no business being applied to someone else's project.
//
// Pure. The caller asks git and stats the disk; this decides what that means.
