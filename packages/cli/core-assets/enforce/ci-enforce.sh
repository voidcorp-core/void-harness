# A lockfile change is legitimate ONLY when a package manifest changed in the same

# sees in package.json. A lockfile changed ALONE (no manifest) is the hand-edit /
# tamper case the floor exists to block. Detect the manifest presence once, up
# front, so the per-file loop can allow a lockfile only when one is present.
# (The local PreToolUse hook still blocks a direct Edit/Write to a lockfile;
# `pnpm add` runs via Bash, so the manifest+lockfile pair is how deps legitimately
# land.) A `git diff` failure here fails CLOSED (manifest treated as absent).
